## Project Overview
C-Voter is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok
Sabha elections 2024 in India. Unlike other channels they do not want to have a
debate on who is going towin this election, they rather wanted to present insights
from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes
like voter turnout percentage in India. As a data analyst in the company, the task 
is to  generate meaningful insights from data.

Step 2: Replaced values --In 2014, Andhra Pradesh underwent bifurcation. For simplicity, all constituencies
from thatyear should be attributed to Telangana state. This includes constituencies
such as Adilabad, Hyderabad, Warangal, etc., which should be considered part of
Telangana rather than Andhra Pradesh for the year 2014.
